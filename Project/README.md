**Anime Recommendation Model using Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering**
<br>In order to access the models one should first download following notebooks: ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb, ContentBasedTraining.ipynb, CollaborativeFilteringTraining.ipynb. To ensure all the necessary packages are available, you should download the following packages on your system:
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib.pyplot
- re
- wordcloud
- scipy
- sklearn

You can use the following commands in the terminal to download these packages using pip:

- pip install matplotlib
- pip install pandas
- pip install seaborn
- pip install re
- pip install wordcloud
- pip install scipy
- pip install sklearn

To run the models you should first run the following notebook:
- ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb : Includes the code for data analysis, visualization and preprocessing.

Then you can run the following notebooks:
- ContentBasedTraining.ipynb : Includes the code for training the content-based model.
- CollaborativeFilteringTraining.ipynb : Includes the code for training the collaborative filtering model.
- HybridModel.ipynb : Includes the code for training the hybrid model.
