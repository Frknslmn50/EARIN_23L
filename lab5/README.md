**FashionMNIST Dataset Classification Using Neural Networks**
<br>To run the Jupyter Notebook "Training_ANN.ipynb," you can either download the notebook or use the Google Colab link. The Google Colab environment is recommended for faster training.<br>To ensure all the necessary packages are available, you should download the following packages on your system. However, if you're using Colab, you don't need to download them as they are pre-installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- torch.nn, torch.optim
- torchvision.transforms

You can use the following commands in the terminal to download these packages using pip:
- pip install numpy
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install pandas
- pip install torch
- pip install torchvision

If you're running the notebook on Google Colab, you'll need to mount your Google Drive to store the dataset. The dataset is provided under the "data" directory, which is required for running the notebook on local systems.
